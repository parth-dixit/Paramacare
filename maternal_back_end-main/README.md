# maternal_back_end

The goal of the project is to develop a health-consultation platform for pregnant women/postpartum. This website will help the patients to locate and consult the  health care providers in their surrounding areas. Women in the rural areas when compared to city people donâ€™t get proper medication/ treatment during their pregnancy and postpartum.
